# Data Analysis and Programming in R

### Project Description:

This project involved completing a comprehensive final assignment with three main components: Analysis, R Package, and Functions/Programming. The assignment was completed using Quarto for documentation, ensuring clear presentation of code and results.

### Analysis:
  - Selected a dataset from Ireland's Open Data Portal, focusing on Table F - Annual Budget 2021, which contained detailed expenditure and income data.
  - Utilized various R programming techniques to conduct data analysis, including data manipulation, graphical visualization, and statistical summaries.
  - Employed popular R packages such as `dplyr` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for visualization, ensuring clear and insightful presentation of results. ðŸ“Š

### R Package:
  - Explored an existing R package not covered in the course, demonstrating its functionality through Quarto.
  - Clearly summarized the purpose of the selected package and showcased key functions using appropriate datasets.
  - Ensured proper documentation and presentation of code and output to meet assessment criteria. ðŸ“¦

### Functions/Programming:
  - Developed custom R functions to provide tailored statistical analysis based on the dataset.
  - Documented the code with comments and provided working examples, incorporating S3 or S4 classes for output and appropriate print, summary, and plot methods.
  - Utilized datasets different from those used in previous parts to showcase versatility and proficiency in R programming. ðŸ’»

### Dataset Description:
- The dataset chosen from Ireland's Open Data Portal was Table F - Annual Budget 2021.
- It comprised expenditure and income data for the budget year, with 17 variables including division references, descriptions, and financial amounts.
- The dataset was loaded and analyzed using R packages such as `tibble` and `dplyr` for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

### Analysis Approach:
- Conducted structured analysis using appropriate R functions and packages, ensuring adherence to project guidelines and assessment criteria.
- Emphasized clarity, reproducibility, and interpretability of results to facilitate easy understanding and evaluation by reviewers.
- Demonstrated proficiency in R programming, data analysis, and documentation techniques throughout the project.

### Conclusion:
- Successfully completed the final project, showcasing technical skills and competence in data science methodologies.
- Provided clear and insightful analysis of the chosen dataset, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- The project served as a comprehensive demonstration of expertise in R programming and data analysis techniques.
